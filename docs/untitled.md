{% hint style="info" %}
The word **annotation** here is very important for reconciling the difference between what Typescript is and what Javascript is. That is, **Typescript isn't real**, and this is a perfect example of why. Typescript ultimately transpiles into Javascript after its done being written, so the writer is allowed to do things like the above example.

**In a way similar to pseudo-code, we are allowed an** _**annotation**_ **that is useful at build-time but ultimately disappears.**
{% endhint %}

In a sense, one might say that **Typescript** is more of an **annotation** of Javascript rather than a **"superset" of it.** \(Perhaps this is all "superset" means, and I just don't understand the word properly.\)
